# Unhandled Exception in ERC20 Token Transfer

This repository demonstrates a common bug in ERC20 token contracts: unhandled exceptions during token transfers.  The `transfer` function lacks proper checks to handle cases where the recipient is not a valid address or is a contract that doesn't implement the ERC20 `transfer` function correctly. This can lead to the transaction failing silently or resulting in unexpected behavior.  The solution includes additional checks and error handling.

## Bug

The original `transfer` function does not handle the scenario where the recipient address is invalid (e.g., 0x0) or a contract that does not correctly implement the ERC20 standard's `transfer` function.  This can lead to a revert, but it might not be caught or handled gracefully.

## Solution

The solution improves the robustness of the `transfer` function by adding checks for both invalid recipient addresses and contracts that don't adhere to the ERC20 standard. The improved function ensures that the token transfer only proceeds if it's safe and predictable, providing better error handling.
